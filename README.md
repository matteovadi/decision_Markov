# decision_Markov
Realization of multiple Matlab scripts for establishing the decision process within a specific industrial automation system, in a Markov Chain environment.

This project has been realized within the course in Data and Decision Analysis at the University of Siena, together with Antonio Ugolini and Gabriele Belardi. The formulation, description and scripts are in Italian. The project dealt with an industrial system, composed by a robot with two arms that has to replenish two different steel baskets with pieces of raw materials, according to a specific decision process, following heuristic and optimal approaches.
